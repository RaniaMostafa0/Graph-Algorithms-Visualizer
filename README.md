Description:
- A Python-based project for visualizing graph algorithms using Tkinter. The application supports BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall search, providing an interactive interface for exploring graph traversal and pathfinding techniques.

Features:
1) Visual representation of graph structures
2) Step-by-step execution of BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall algorithms
3) Interactive interface
4) Dynamic pathfinding visualization
